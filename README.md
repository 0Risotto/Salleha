# SALLEHA – Smart Maintenance System

**Systems Analysis and Design Project – University of Jordan**  
*First Semester 2025/2026*

This repository contains the **complete documentation** for **SALLEHA**, a web and mobile-based maintenance management system developed as part of the **Systems Analysis and Design** course at the **University of Jordan**.

## Project Overview

**SALLEHA** is a centralized maintenance request platform designed to streamline reporting, assignment, and tracking of maintenance issues in residential, academic, and office facilities. The system improves communication, transparency, and efficiency between residents, technicians, and administrators.

### Key Features:
- **Role-based dashboards** for Residents, Technicians, and Administrators
- **Ticket submission** with images, location tagging, and priority levels
- **Real-time notifications** and status tracking
- **Analytics and reporting** for administrators
- **Duplicate ticket prevention** and maintenance history
- **Secure authentication** and profile management

## Contents

This documentation covers:

1. **Project Initiation** – Problem definition, feasibility studies, vision document
2. **Project Management Plan** – Roles, schedules, risk analysis, communication plan
3. **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** – Stakeholders, use cases, functional & non-functional requirements
4. **System Design** – Context diagrams, use case models, data requirements
5. **Prototype Mockups** – UI designs for all user roles
6. **Validation & Review** – Requirement verification methods
