== Software Process Model
\
We are going to use the Waterfall Software Process Model. This model is suitable because our project goals and requirements are clearly defined from the beginning, and we have a strict timeline to follow. Since this model is based on a highly structured approach, it will help us maintain organization and ensure that all deliverables are completed on time.

The main phases include:

- Requirements Analysis and Specification:

Requirements Analysis: Gathering and understanding all the requirements of the client, then documenting and analyzing them.

Requirement Specification: Documenting the analyzed requirements in a software requirement specification document that serves as a reference for the next phases.

\
- System Design:
Translating the requirements from the requirement specification document into a detailed system design as well as creating the overall architecture.

\
- Development:
Developing the web and mobile applications according to the designs created earlier, using a suitable programming languages and frameworks.

\
- Testing and Deployment:
Testing the whole software and verifying that all components work correctly and satisfy user expectations. After testing, the software is ready and available for use.

\
- Maintenance:
The final, ongoing phase. It ensures that the software remains functional, secure, and up-to-date throughout its operational life.

== Project Environment 

#text([
- Procedures: \ #text([
  - Initiation:
Establish the project team, define the requirements goals, and potential risks.
  - Planning:
Create a detailed project plan using the Waterfall methodology, this includes outlining all necessary steps, allocating resources, and developing cost, schedule, and communication plans to achieve our outcomes.

  - Execution and Testing:
Implement the planned activities and test them carefully to ensure quality and functionality.

  - Monitoring:
Track progress and compare it with planned goals to ensure timely delivery and quality control.

  - Documentation:
All design diagrams, reports, and testing results are documented using Typst and stored in a shared repository to ensure collaboration among team members.

\
== Communication Plan

\
Our team will maintain communication through online meetings using Google Meet, and instant messaging using a WhatsApp group to assign tasks and ensure that everyone is updated on progress and deadlines.

Communication Methods:

In-Class Meetings: Held every Sunday to discuss progress, issues, and next steps.

Out-of-Class Meetings: Through Google Meet whenever there is a need for rapid discussion.

Messaging: A WhatsApp group for updates and daily coordination.

Version Control: GitHub is used for tracking code updates and version history.

\
- We also use GitHub to store and organize our documentation created using Typst, ensuring all of us can access the latest versions easily.
