== Software Process Model
We are going to use the Waterfall
Software Process Model. This model is suitable 
because our project goals and requirements are clearly defined from the beginning,
and we have a strict timeline to follow. Since this model
is based on a highly structured approach, it will help us maintain organization and ensure that all deliverables are completed on time.
See @WaterfallSoftwareProcessModel.

=== Main Phases :
+ *Requirements Analysis and Specification:*
  - Requirements Analysis: Gathering and understanding all the requirements of the client, then documenting and analyzing them.
  - Requirement Specification: Documenting the analyzed requirements in a software requirement specification document that serves as a reference for the next phases.
+ *System Design:*
  - Translating the requirements from the requirement specification document into a detailed system design as well as creating the overall architecture.
+ *Development:*
  - Developing the web and mobile applications according to the designs created earlier, using a suitable programming languages and frameworks.
+ *Testing and Deployment:*
  - Testing the whole software and verifying that all components work correctly and satisfy user expectations. After testing, the software is ready and available for use.
+ *Maintenance:*
  - The final, ongoing phase. It ensures that the software remains functional, secure, and up-to-date throughout its operational life.

== Project Environment  
  === Procedures
  - *Initiation:*
     - Establish the project team, define the requirements goals, and potential risks.
  - *Planning:*
    - Create a detailed project plan using the Waterfall methodology, this includes outlining all necessary steps, allocating resources, and developing cost, schedule, and communication plans to achieve our outcomes.
  - *Execution and Testing:*
    - Implement the planned activities and test them carefully to ensure quality and functionality.
  - *Monitoring:*
    - Track progress and compare it with planned goals to ensure timely delivery and quality control.
  - *Documentation:*
    - All design diagrams, reports, and testing results are documented using Typst and stored in a shared repository to ensure collaboration among team members.
