== Communication Plan

Our team will maintain communication through online meetings using Google Meet, and instant messaging using a WhatsApp group to assign tasks and ensure that everyone is updated on progress and deadlines.
*Communication Methods:* 
- In-Class Meetings: 
  - Held every Sunday to discuss progress, issues, and next steps.
- Out-of-Class Meetings:
  - Through Google Meet whenever there is a need for rapid discussion.
- Messaging: 
  - A WhatsApp group for updates and daily coordination.
- Version Control: 
  - GitHub is used for tracking code updates and version history.
  - We also use GitHub to store and organize our documentation created using Typst, ensuring all of us can access the latest versions easily.
