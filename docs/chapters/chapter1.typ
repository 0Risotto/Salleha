== Project Overview

Salleha is a platform designed for managing maintenance requests in 
facilities like offices or residential buildings, making maintenance and 
reporting more efficient and easier. Users can report issues, track progress, 
and get updates. Admins and technicians can assign, prioritize, and resolve
tasks effectively.

== Problem Definition 
In many residential buildings, offices, and shared facilities people often  
face significant challenges in reaching authority of those In charge of
maintenance managers and staff. In traditional methods such as : emails, 
paper forms, or phone calls, are typically inefficient, lack transparency and lead to delays.
This often creates a communication  gap between users and the authorities responsible, which results in frustration, unaddressed issues, and potential safety hazards.

=== Issues
#let issue1 = text([Users often struggle to reach the right maintenance personnel, resulting in delays or ignored requests. Without a centralized and accessible system, reporting issues becomes time-consuming and unreliable.])
#let issue2 = text([Maintenance teams often work without proper tools to prioritize, assign, and track tasks. This leads to missed or delayed repairs, no clear ownership of responsibilities, and no data to measure performance or improve operations.])
#let issue3 = text([Users rarely receive updates on the status of their maintenance requests. This lack of visibility creates frustration and reduces trust in the system, while maintenance teams struggle to keep everyone informed. ])
#let issue4 = text([Users lack Privacy through and through with traditional reporting methods, this can lead to an upset and distrust to some people. Users care for their own privacy hence why some reports have never been sent before because of their own worry about the system.  ])

==== Problem Description
Ever since the digitalization of almost everything, people's expectations rose. People are
in constant demand of systems that fulfills there needs. Current methods are almost obsolete
they are ineffecient and insuffecient because the older methods have lack of transparency,
increased delays, and unavaliable hence the overall user frustration, not to mention the 
diffuculty of managing the reports.

Without a system to hold everything together it require a lot of effort to pull through the maintenance tasks.
To satisfy users, they need a system to adapt to their needs. Providing a smooth, painless experience
through an easy to use interface.A system is needed such that it enables feedback submission, tracks administrative responses, and provides data-driven
insights for continuous service improvement. Delaying this solution risks further dissatisfaction and
missed opportunities for institutional growth.

== Recommended Solution and Expected Project Deliverables
To manage the maintenance requests of issues as they arise,
we can use a great solution: a Maintenance Request software system
that allows requesters to report maintenance issues directly
to the maintenance team using a web-based form or mobile app.
It helps streamline communication,
submission, and tracking without wasting time
gathering complete and accurate information or delaying repairs.
The people who the maintenance teams usually rely on,
such as employees and visitors,
will be able to submit detailed maintenance
forms that include descriptions, images,
and location information. Other processes
such as workflows for reviewing and
approving requests will be managed through a
dashboard that allows the team to assign,
prioritize, and monitor tasks.
Technicians can update the status of
each request in real time, and notifications
will be sent to users to inform them about progress and completion.

#underline[Expected Deliverables:]
A Maintenance Request Software that will include:
- *Request Submission:*
Maintenance teams will accept requests through
the system to ensure they collect all necessary
information to proceed with other maintenance processes.\
Users will submit it like a post; It'll have a title, location, photo and description.

- *Review and Approve Requests:*
A dashboard and analysis tool will help
the organization review all forms and decide
which requests will be approved.
Each request will be evaluated to
ensure that it is valid,
not redundant, and not already being addressed.

*Status Updates to Deliver Better Customer Service:*
To build trust between managers and customers, there will be a communication tool that responds back to requesters to inform them that their requests are accepted and to update them about the status of their issues until completion. These updates will be automated through real-time notifications.

*Database Design and Documentation:*
For storing and tracking requests, there will be request records that provide a clear view of all issues, and a database that documents what issues were reported, how they were resolved, and when. This will help with future planning and decision-making, as well as provide tools for summarizing the analysis, design, and implementation process.

*Performance Tracking:*
Updates on team work status for measuring team performance will help ensure that the original problem has been addressed and will identify bottlenecks in the request process. This will lead to providing excellent customer service and demonstrate that the maintenance team is responsive, works well, and continues improving the organization’s overall reputation. This will be done by tracking average response time and turnaround time.

== Local and Global Impact of the Proposed Solution 
*Locally:* The maintenance request system will ensure accuracy and enable the maintenance team to begin planning and scheduling maintenance work more quickly through automatically generated work orders from approved requests. Following best practices will also provide better customer service in this area. Automation means better experiences! It will reduce delays in handling requests, minimize manual paperwork, and ensure maintenance work is managed from start to finish through automated tools. This can lead to better resource management, higher efficiency, and greater satisfaction not just among staff but also among customers by keeping them updated about the status of their requests without delaying feedback.

*Globally:* It contributes to digital transformation and sustainability efforts. It is essential for businesses of all sizes to rely on such systems in their operations to efficiently allocate resources and maximize the performance of their assets.
A well-designed maintenance request system demonstrates how technology enables organizations to make data-driven decisions to achieve better operational efficiency by centralizing all maintenance requests in one platform.
